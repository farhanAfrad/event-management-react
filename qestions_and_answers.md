<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>Here two things happened. 1st, declaration of greeting varibale is done by doing, let greeting. 2nd, initialization is done by doing greeting = {}. {} it is a syntax of empty object, means an empty object is assigned to the variable greeting. That is why printing greeting will give an empty object.</i>

#### Answer: C

<i>Here a function defination is given where it will add two variable and returns the value of sum. When this function is called with two arguments, one is number and another one is a string it will concat the number with string and give the result as string. This is how javascript works. Because of that it will concat the number 1 with the string '2' and give the result as string '12'</i>
